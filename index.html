                        <p> I'm newly a web developer taking this course to advance my career and fine-tune my skills.
                            I have an associate's degree in math and science from Mira Costa College. I enjoy math and
                            working with
                            numbers. I was born in Ann Arbor Michigan in 1988. Shortly after I moved to Seattle,
                            Washington. I spent a majority of my childhood in Washington until 1998, when I moved to
                            Del Mar, California.
                            For roughly over 20 years my current residence has been California. I enjoy eating and
                            living healthy and decidied to start my own business doing so. For the past seven years i
                            have ran my own
                            mobile personal training company. During the process of building my business I was
                            introduced to web design. While designing my company's needed up and coming website, I was
                            inspired to learn more indepth
                            the back functioning of coding.
